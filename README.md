# LogicBulb ðŸ’¡

My house has a weird circuit problem related to the light bulbs of the stairs between floors. 
These things don't work as you would normally expect, some annoying logic conditions are required for them to light your way. 

## Due to this situation, obvious actions were needed:

I made an app that simulates my house stubborn light bulbs.
No rocket science coding here, just a simple way for the world to know what I have to deal with everyday :p

Just for fun (for now).

### To run it:
