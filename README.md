# LogicBulb

My house has a weird circuit problem related to the lightbulbs of the stairs between floors. 
This things don't work as you would normally expect, some annoying logic conditions are required for them to light your way. 

## Due to this situation, obvious actions were needed:

I made an app that simulates my house stubborn lightbulbs.
Not rocket science coding, just a simple way for the world to know what I have to deal with everyday :p

Just for fun (for now).
